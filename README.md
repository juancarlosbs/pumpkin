## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)
- Docker and Docker Compose
- pnpm or npm

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/workout-tracker.git
cd workout-tracker
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Start the PostgreSQL database using Docker:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
This will create a container named `workout-tracker-db` with PostgreSQL running on port 5432.

4. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

5. Run database migrations:
```bash
cd apps/api
npx prisma migrate dev
```

6. Seed the database with initial data:
```bash
npm run prisma:seed
```

7. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
